/**
 * Tagged component that contains a value that indicates the Java
 * serialization version supported by the ORB.
 *
 * ORB Java serialization uses IIOP as the transport protocol, but uses
 * Java serialization mechanism and its accompanying encodings, instead
 * of IIOP CDR serialization mechanism. Java serialization is generally
 * observed to be faster than CDR.
