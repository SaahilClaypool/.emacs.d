/**
 * A class which tags a window with a particular semantic usage,
 * either tooltip, menu, sub-menu, popup-menu, or comobobox-popup.
 * This is used as a temporary solution for getting native AWT support
 * for transition effects in Windows 98 and Windows 2000.  The native
 * code will interpret the windowType property and automatically
 * implement appropriate animation when the window is shown/hidden.
 * <p>
 * Note that support for transition effects may be supported with a
 * different mechanism in the future and so this class is
 * package-private and targeted for Swing implementation use only.
 * <p>
 * <strong>Warning:</strong>
 * Serialized objects of this class will not be compatible with
 * future Swing releases.  The current serialization support is appropriate
 * for short term storage or RMI between applications running the same
 * version of Swing.  A future release of Swing will provide support for
 * long term persistence.
