public interface ORBInitInfoExt

/** The interface defines an extension to the standard ORBInitInfo
 * that gives access to the ORB being initialized.  Interceptors run
 * as the last stage of initialization of the ORB, so the ORB
 * instance returned by getORB is fully initialized.  Note that
 * this facility eventually shows up post-CORBA 3.0 as a result
 * of the resolution of OMG core issue on accessing the ORB from
 * local objects.
