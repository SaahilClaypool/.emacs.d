/**
 * A {@code CallSite} is a holder for a variable {@link MethodHandle},
 * which is called its {@code target}.
 * An {@code invokedynamic} instruction linked to a {@code CallSite} delegates
 * all calls to the site's current target.
 * A {@code CallSite} may be associated with several {@code invokedynamic}
 * instructions, or it may be "free floating", associated with none.
 * In any case, it may be invoked through an associated method handle
 * called its {@linkplain #dynamicInvoker dynamic invoker}.
 * <p>
 * {@code CallSite} is an abstract class which does not allow
 * direct subclassing by users.  It has three immediate,
 * concrete subclasses that may be either instantiated or subclassed.
 * <ul>
 * <li>If a mutable target is not required, an {@code invokedynamic} instruction
 * may be permanently bound by means of a {@linkplain ConstantCallSite constant call site}.
 * <li>If a mutable target is required which has volatile variable semantics,
 * because updates to the target must be immediately and reliably witnessed by other threads,
 * a {@linkplain VolatileCallSite volatile call site} may be used.
 * <li>Otherwise, if a mutable target is required,
 * a {@linkplain MutableCallSite mutable call site} may be used.
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * A non-constant call site may be <em>relinked</em> by changing its target.
 * The new target must have the same {@linkplain MethodHandle#type() type}
 * as the previous target.
 * Thus, though a call site can be relinked to a series of
 * successive targets, it cannot change its type.
 * <p>
 * Here is a sample use of call sites and bootstrap methods which links every
 * dynamic call site to print its arguments:
<blockquote><pre>{@code
