/**
 * A FocusTraversalPolicy which provides support for legacy applications which
 * handle focus traversal via JComponent.setNextFocusableComponent or by
 * installing a custom DefaultFocusManager. If a specific traversal has not
 * been hard coded, then that traversal is provided either by the custom
 * DefaultFocusManager, or by a wrapped FocusTraversalPolicy instance.
