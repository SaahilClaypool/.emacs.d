 * A special painter implementation for tool bar separators in Nimbus.
 * The designer tool doesn't have support for painters which render
 * repeated patterns, but that's exactly what the toolbar separator design
 * is for Nimbus. This custom painter is designed to handle this situation.
 * When support is added to the design tool / code generator to deal with
 * repeated patterns, then we can remove this class.
