/**
 * An object that may hold resources (such as file or socket handles)
 * until it is closed. The {@link #close()} method of an {@code AutoCloseable}
 * object is called automatically when exiting a {@code
 * try}-with-resources block for which the object has been declared in
 * the resource specification header. This construction ensures prompt
 * release, avoiding resource exhaustion exceptions and errors that
 * may otherwise occur.
 *
 * @apiNote
 * <p>It is possible, and in fact common, for a base class to
 * implement AutoCloseable even though not all of its subclasses or
 * instances will hold releasable resources.  For code that must operate
 * in complete generality, or when it is known that the {@code AutoCloseable}
 * instance requires resource release, it is recommended to use {@code
 * try}-with-resources constructions. However, when using facilities such as
 * {@link java.util.stream.Stream} that support both I/O-based and
 * non-I/O-based forms, {@code try}-with-resources blocks are in
 * general unnecessary when using non-I/O-based forms.
