/**
 * This class implements a DesktopManager which more closely follows
 * the MDI model than the DefaultDesktopManager.  Unlike the
 * DefaultDesktopManager policy, MDI requires that the selected
 * and activated child frames are the same, and that that frame
 * always be the top-most window.
 * <p>
 * The maximized state is managed by the DesktopManager with MDI,
 * instead of just being a property of the individual child frame.
 * This means that if the currently selected window is maximized
 * and another window is selected, that new window will be maximized.
