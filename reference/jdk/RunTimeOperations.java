public interface RunTimeOperations

/** Defines operations on the base class that represents the Sending Context of a
* request.  The sending context provides access to information about
* the runtime environment of the originator of a GIOP message.  For example,
* when a value type is marshalled on a GIOP Request message, the receiver
* of the value type may need to ask the sender about the CodeBase for the
* implementation of the value type.
