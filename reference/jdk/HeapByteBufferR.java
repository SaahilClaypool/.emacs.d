class HeapByteBufferR

/**



 * A read-only HeapByteBuffer.  This class extends the corresponding
 * read/write class, overriding the mutation methods to throw a {@link
 * ReadOnlyBufferException} and overriding the view-buffer methods to return an
 * instance of this class rather than of the superclass.
