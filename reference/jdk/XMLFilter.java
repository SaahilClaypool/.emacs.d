 * <p>An XML filter is like an XML reader, except that it obtains its
 * events from another XML reader rather than a primary source like
 * an XML document or database.  Filters can modify a stream of
 * events as they pass on to the final application.</p>
 *
 * <p>The XMLFilterImpl helper class provides a convenient base
 * for creating SAX2 filters, by passing on all {@link org.xml.sax.EntityResolver
 * EntityResolver}, {@link org.xml.sax.DTDHandler DTDHandler},
 * {@link org.xml.sax.ContentHandler ContentHandler} and {@link org.xml.sax.ErrorHandler
 * ErrorHandler} events automatically.</p>
