 *
 * <p>ParserFactory is not part of the platform-independent definition
 * of SAX; it is an additional convenience class designed
 * specifically for Java XML application writers.  SAX applications
 * can use the static methods in this class to allocate a SAX parser
 * dynamically at run-time based either on the value of the
 * `org.xml.sax.parser' system property or on a string containing the class
 * name.</p>
 *
 * <p>Note that the application still requires an XML parser that
 * implements SAX1.</p>
